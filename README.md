## Great Sphere
For Dr. Brittany Fasy

## Instructions

Once in root directory, type:
mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

./greatsphere

It should take roughly 10 min for the sphere to compile. To make the image look sharper,
add in more triangles in main.cpp (in the sphere constructor, look for comments in code).

Unfortunaytely, this takes a bit to render and also look nice.

One may zoom in and out on the sphere using '+' and '-', and rotate the sphere using
'u', 'i', 'o', 'p', '[', '['.
